This is the main folder for all the POC.

**Pharmacovigilance-test** is the 'unofficial' POC used as tutorial for showing how to configure and use Camel, Drools, Spring, JTA, JMX, JPA, logstash and Weblogic 12c as J2EE application server. 

**Pharmacovigilance** is the replacement of the actual messaging system used in EMA for human adr.


The project is ufficially moved to the internal EMA git repository.
